# Inkless

A less version of [Zurb's ink](http://zurb.com/ink/) stylesheet, in case your email is not exactly **580px** wide.


# Usage

Use this less file instead of the default `ink.css` and configure the grid to your need using the `@columnWidth` 
and `@gutterWidth` variables. Compile to css using your favorite tool.
